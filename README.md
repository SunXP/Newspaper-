# Newspaper- Justifying program
Parse string into newspaper article format:

Program where the user inputs the number of characters per line along with the article he wants to format. The program will parse through the string and return the line with no modifications if the last character is a space or a punctuation. If not, the program will stop the line with a hyphen, then start on the next line. If the last character is the letter of a word, the program will allow a punctuation to follow, but will remove the space character for the following line.
